# Receptka (PL)
My first full-working app.
An old MFC-based project created to help my father in his clinic.
It collected patients' personal data in MS Access database and could print it on prescription put into a printer.
It made writing prescriptions faster for regular patients.

I started rewriting it into C# .NET using SQLite, but abandonded it in 2010, because professional, certified software for clinics appeared.
